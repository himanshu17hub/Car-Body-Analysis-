# Car Body Structural Analysis â€“ ANSYS Project

This repository contains simulation files and results for a simplified **car body analysis** performed using **ANSYS Workbench**. The project focuses on evaluating stress, deformation, and safety under static and frontal impact loading using **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**.

---

## Overview

- Simulated real-world loading on a car chassis/body  
- Analyzed stress distribution and total deformation  
- Used mild steel material properties  
- Applied static and impact conditions  
- Optimized mesh for accurate results

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Applied FEM concepts in ANSYS  
- Understood structural behavior under load  
- Gained skills in meshing, boundary conditions, and result interpretation

---

## Tools Used

- ANSYS Workbench 2023  
- Static Structural Module
